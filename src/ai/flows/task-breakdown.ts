CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Break down high-level learning goals into weekly modules with specific daily objectives
2. Start each week with "WEEKLY GOAL: By end of week, you will have [specific measurable outcome]"
3. Include day-by-day breakdown showing exactly what to focus on each day
4. Use action verbs: Download, Install, Create, Configure, Write, Test, Debug, Practice, Study, Build
5. Include specific file names, URLs, commands, tools, or learning resources where applicable
6. Each day should have realistic learning goals fitting within ${values.hoursPerDayCommitment} hours
7. **MANDATORY: End each week with "WEEK END MILESTONE: [What learner should be able to do/demonstrate]"**
8. Ensure logical progression from week to week, building on previous knowledge

SPECIFICATIONS:
- Total Duration: ${values.targetTime} ${values.targetTimeUnit}
- Daily Time: ${values.hoursPerDayCommitment} hours per day
- Weekly Time: ${hoursPerWeek} hours per week
- Skill Level: Assume beginner unless task specifies otherwise

DURATION CALCULATION:
- Total Hours Needed: ${totalHours} hours
- Hours Per Week: ${hoursPerWeek} hours (${values.hoursPerDayCommitment} hours/day Ã— 7 days)
- Total Weeks Required: ${totalWeeks} weeks

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - READ CAREFULLY:
You MUST generate exactly ${totalWeeks} weekly entries in the "breakdown" array. 

DO NOT STOP EARLY! DO NOT GENERATE ONLY A FEW WEEKS!

The breakdown array must contain ${totalWeeks} objects, numbered from Week 1 to Week ${totalWeeks}.

EXAMPLES of the specificity required for weekly learning plans:

BAD: "Learn the basics this week"
GOOD: 
"WEEKLY GOAL: By end of week, you will have a working development environment and completed your first functional project"
"Day-by-day breakdown:"
"â€¢ Monday (${values.hoursPerDayCommitment}h): Download and install SDK, set up IDE, verify installation with 'hello world'"
"â€¢ Tuesday (${values.hoursPerDayCommitment}h): Study basic syntax through official documentation and beginner tutorials"
"â€¢ Wednesday (${values.hoursPerDayCommitment}h): Practice variables, data types, and basic operations with coding exercises"
"â€¢ Thursday (${values.hoursPerDayCommitment}h): Learn control structures (if/else, loops) through guided practice problems"
"â€¢ Friday (${values.hoursPerDayCommitment}h): Study functions and scope through practical examples and mini-projects"
"â€¢ Saturday (${values.hoursPerDayCommitment}h): Build a simple calculator project combining all week's concepts"
"â€¢ Sunday (${values.hoursPerDayCommitment}h): Code review, debugging practice, and preparation for next week's advanced topics"
"WEEK END MILESTONE: Complete a functional calculator app that demonstrates all basic programming concepts learned this week"

REQUIRED FORMAT:
- Start each week with "WEEKLY GOAL: By end of week, you will have [specific learning outcome]"
- Include day-by-day breakdown with specific daily learning objectives
- Include specific learning resources, documentation links, tutorial URLs, or tools for each day
- Add practical projects/exercises that demonstrate weekly learning progress
- Ensure logical progression from week to week, building on previous knowledge
- Each week should total exactly ${hoursPerWeek} hours (${values.hoursPerDayCommitment} hours Ã— 7 days)
- **MANDATORY: Every single week MUST end with "WEEK END MILESTONE: [Specific achievement/project/demonstration]"**

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE for ${totalWeeks} weeks:
{
  "breakdown": [
    { "unit": "Week 1 (${hoursPerWeek} hours total - ${values.hoursPerDayCommitment} hours/day)", "tasks": [...] },
    { "unit": "Week 2 (${hoursPerWeek} hours total - ${values.hoursPerDayCommitment} hours/day)", "tasks": [...] },
    { "unit": "Week 3 (${hoursPerWeek} hours total - ${values.hoursPerDayCommitment} hours/day)", "tasks": [...] },
    ...continue this pattern...
    { "unit": "Week ${totalWeeks} (${hoursPerWeek} hours total - ${values.hoursPerDayCommitment} hours/day)", "tasks": [...] }
  ]
}

ðŸš¨ THE BREAKDOWN ARRAY MUST HAVE EXACTLY ${totalWeeks} OBJECTS ðŸš¨

ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL REMINDER: Every single week's tasks array must end with "WEEK END MILESTONE: [specific achievement]"
