# PDF Pagination Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Downloaded task breakdown PDFs were ending at page 1 with the message "... (continued on next page)" but no additional pages were generated, causing users to lose the majority of their content.

## Root Cause
The PDF generation code in `src/components/download-breakdown.tsx` had a single-page limitation:

```typescript
// OLD PROBLEMATIC CODE
if (currentY < 50) {
  page.drawText('... (continued on next page)', {
    x: 50,
    y: currentY,
    size: fontSize,
    color: rgb(0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
  });
  break; // ❌ This stopped generation instead of creating new pages
}
```

## Solution Implemented
Replaced the single-page PDF generation with a robust multi-page system:

### Key Improvements:
1. **Automatic Page Creation**: Generates new pages when content exceeds boundaries
2. **Smart Page Headers**: Adds appropriate headers on each page ("Task Breakdown" on page 1, "Task Breakdown (Page N)" on subsequent pages)
3. **Text Wrapping**: Handles long task descriptions by wrapping text across lines
4. **Proper Margins**: Maintains consistent spacing and margins throughout the document
5. **Complete Content**: Ensures ALL task breakdown content is included in the PDF

### Technical Implementation:
- **Page Break Logic**: Checks available space before adding content
- **Dynamic Page Addition**: Creates new pages with proper headers when needed
- **Font Management**: Pre-loads fonts for better performance
- **Line Height Calculations**: Ensures proper spacing between elements
- **Content Overflow Handling**: Intelligently breaks content across pages

## Files Modified
- `src/components/download-breakdown.tsx` - Complete rewrite of PDF generation logic
