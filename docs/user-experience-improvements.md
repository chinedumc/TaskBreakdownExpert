## Integration Points

### With Existing Analytics System

The dashboard integrates with the existing analytics infrastructure:

```typescript
interface AnalyticsData {
  visitsCount: number;        // From track-visit endpoint
  downloadsCount: number;     // From track-download endpoint
  totalBreakdowns: number;    // Calculated from breakdown API usage
  lastVisit: Date | string;   // From analytics tracking
  averageSessionTime?: number; // Future enhancement
  popularTasks?: string[];    // Future enhancement
}
```

### With Task Breakdown Flow

The enhanced AI service works with existing task breakdown types:

```typescript
import { TaskBreakdownOutput } from './flows/task-breakdown';

// Analyzes existing breakdown structure
EnhancedTaskAI.analyzeTaskBreakdown(breakdown: TaskBreakdownOutput)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features (in feature branch):
1. **Progress Tracking**: Track completion status of individual tasks
2. **Smart Notifications**: Remind users of their learning schedule
3. **Social Features**: Share achievements and learning paths
4. **Learning Path Templates**: Pre-built templates for common skills
5. **Time Tracking**: Actual vs. estimated time tracking
6. **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed usage insights

### Data Collection Enhancements:
- Task category tracking
